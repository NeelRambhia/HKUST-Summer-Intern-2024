This Repository consists of all my work I did during my Research Internship at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (May '24 - July '24).
There are three different Python codes avaialible:
1) Calculation of the coupling coefficient $\beta$ from the Refractive Index v/s Wavelength data after applying either a polynomial regression or a cauchy fit to the data.
2) Calculating the Q - factor using the inbuilt functions of the Scipy library (this is not very accuarate though).
3) Modifying the process in (2) to first fit the Voigt profile to the resonance valleys of Transmission and finding Q factor from the fitted Voigt curve. This will give much more accurate results.

Additonal files in other branches are the Lumerical Script files for Notch Type Ring Resonator simulation, Bent Waveguide Ring Resonator simulation and the script code for calculating coupling coefficient from the transmission v/s wavelength data.
I have also added the text files containing the Transmission v/s Wavelength data for different Ring Resonator structures and dimensions, which were used in the above Python code files.
